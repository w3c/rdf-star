      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <!--<p>The deliverables of this Community Group are described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">Community Group Charter</a>. For convenience those deliverables are replicated in this chapter. The charter remains the authoritative source of the definition of deliverables.</p> -->

        <h3>Use Cases </h3>

    </section>

    <section id="Methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>In order to find out the challenges when specifying RDF* by this Community Group, use cases were collected. For the purpose of the Community Group, a use case is a story that describes challenges with respect to the extension of RDF, named RDF* for existing or envisaged information systems. 
	  It does not  need to adhere to certain standardized format. 
	  Use cases are primarily used to clarify the goal of RDF* , but a use case could be revisited near the time the work of the Community Group will reach completion, to demonstrate that it is now possible to make the use case work.</p>

    <section id="UseCases">
      <!--A HTML template for use cases can be found at the end of this section -->
      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Use cases that describe current problems or future opportunities for spatial data on the Web have been gathered as a first activity of the Community Group. They were mainly contributed by members of Community Group, but there were also contributions from other interested parties. In this chapter these use cases are listed and identified. Each use case is related to one or more Community Group <a href="#Deliverables">deliverables</a> and to one or more <a href="#Requirements">requirements</a> for future deliverables.</p>

WMO has the same status as ISO, and its standards and regulatory materials applies to all its 193 national meteorological services and are available in the six working languages ( عربي | 中文 | Fr | Ru | Es | En). WMO has embarked on a long-term (think a decade or so) program to update the global meteorological operational infrastructure. This is known as the WIS (WMO Information System). The global infrastructure also has aviation, oceanographic, seismic and other users. The WIS includes a global, federated, synchronized, geospatial catalog, envisaged to encompass all hydro-meteorological data and services. Currently several nodes are operational, cataloging mainly routinely exchanged observations and forecasts.</p>
          <p>Envisage an environmental scientist in Cambodia, researching the impact of deforestation in Vietnam as part of investigating the regional impacts of climate change. She submits her search keywords, in Cambodian, and receives responses indicating there is some data from the 1950s, printed in a 1960 pamphlet, in the Bibliothèque Nationale, a library in Paris, France, in French. She receives an abstract of some form that enables her to decide that the data are worth accessing, and initiates a request for a digital copy to be sent.</p>
          <p>She receives the pamphlet as a scanned image of each page, and she decides that the quantitative information in the paper is useful, so she arranges transcription of the tabular numerical data and their summary values into a digital form and publishes the dataset, with a persistent identifier, and links it to a detailed coverage extent, the original paper source, the scanned pages and her paper when it is published. She also incorporates scanned charts and graphs from the original pamphlet into her paper. Her organization creates a catalog record for her research paper dataset and publishes it in the WIS global catalog, which makes it also visible to the GEO System of Systems broker portal.</p>

          <!--<p>With the increasing availability of small, mobile location aware devices the requirement to identify a location human terms is becoming more important. While the determination of sensor in space to a high level of precision is a largely solved problem we are less able to express the location in terms meaningful to humans. The fact that the Bluetooth-LE tracker attached to my bag is at 51.4256853,-0.3317991,4.234500 is much less useful than the description, "Under your bed at home". At others times the location descriptions "24 Bridgeman Road, Teddington, TW11 8AH, UK" might be equally valid, as might "Teddington", "South West London", "England", "UK", "Inside", "Where you left it Yesterday", "Upstairs", "45 minutes from here" or "150 meters from the Post Office".</p>
          <p>A better understanding of how we describe places in human terms, the hierarchical nature of places and the fuzzy nature of many geographical entities will be needed to make the "Internet of Things" manageable. A new scale of geospatial analysis may be required using a reference frame based on the locations of individuals rather than a global spherical co-ordinate, allowing a location of your keys and their attached bluetooth tag to be described as "in the kitchen".</p>
