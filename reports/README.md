This is a collection of individual
[EARL reports](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) for
test subjects claiming JSON-LD processor conformance.

The consolidated report is generated using the
[earl-report Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/earl-report),
which saves it to `index.html`.

Run it as follows:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
```
