         This document describes use cases that justify the extension of RDF in the current work in RDF star
        community group. It is  collaborative work and is a non normative part of this group output.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p>
        This document collects together use cases and requirments for RDF* (RDF Star).
        These use case were provided by members of the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/rdf-dev/">W3C RDF Community Group</a>
        on the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-star/"
                  >RDF* mailing list</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star/issues/29">issue 29</a>
        of the  community's GitHub repository.

        <h3>Annotations of triples that are not in the graph</h3>
        <p class="contributor">Richard Cyganiak.</p>
        <p>I want to be able to annotate triples that are not in the graph</p>
        <p>As an web user, I want to be able to annotate any triples,
          regardless of whether they are in the same graph or not. Then I can annotate
          triples in a graph elsewhere on the web.
        </p>

        <h3>Annotations of triples where the triples are in another graph of the same RDF Dataset</h3>
        <p class="contributor">Andy Seaborne</p>
        <p>
          As an information engineer, I want to be able to manage annotation triples
          separately from the data triples themselves. I wish to have a separategraph in
          the same RDF dataset.
          This will make data management more convenient - e.g. publishing without
          annotations; e.g. querying the data without the annotations visible.

        <h3>Combination of RDF* and graph-level metadata (named graphs)</h3>
        <p class="contributor">Dan Brickley</p>
        <p>I want to use an RDF* triple to capture something like, 
          e.g., "the graph denoted by IRI ex:mygraph contains the edge/triple (ex:Bob, foaf:knows, ex:Alice)."</p>

        <p>I want to combine TriG notation / Named Graph / RDF* all together. What is feasible or not with RDF*?</p>
